## ℹ️ A Sports Facts Website using HTML and Minimal CSS

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

A HTML website with minimal CSS built as part of my earliest lessons in frontend development.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project displays a fictional table tennis tournament leaderboard using semantic HTML and light CSS styling. I built this as a continuation of learning how to structure real-world data on the web.

It includes a ranked leaderboard, a breakdown of official rules, and a tournament-style match setup using semantic tags like `<section>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, and `<table>`. I also practiced linking to external sources and improving page navigation.
